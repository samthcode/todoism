  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Todoism is a homemade todo-list application. There are an abundance of these
    in the wild, so let me tell you what makes Todoism unique:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>It's simple!</b> Just choose a list and add a todo!</li>
    <li><b>It's free!</b> It is, and always will be, free!</li>
    <li>
      <b>I'm just a guy.</b> I'm not some evil corporation, i'm just a guy who wants
      to have some fun!
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>It's secure.</b> Todoism just uses a JS object (and will use indexedDB in
      future) so there is no risk of your todos being leaked!
    </li>
  </ul>
